# Largest Number

Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: A = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
Output: 9534330
Explanation: Largest possible number that can be formed is 9534330
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= |A| <= 10^5
0 <= Ai <= 10^9
```
