# Valid Ip Addresses

Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.

A valid IP address must be in the form of A.B.C.D, where A,B,C and D are numbers from 0-255. The numbers cannot be 0 prefixed unless they are 0.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: A = "25525511135"
Output:  [“255.255.11.135”, “255.255.111.35”]

### Constraints
```sh
0 <= A.length <= 20
```
