# Sort A Stack

You are given a stack consisting of N integers.
Your task is to sort this stack in descending order using recursion.

```sh
is_empty(S) : Tests whether stack is empty or not.
push(S) : Adds a new element to the stack.
pop(S) : Removes top element from the stack.
top(S) : Returns value of the top element. Note that this function does not remove elements from the stack.
```

### Example 1
```sh
Input: N = [5, -2, 9, -7, 3]
Output: [9, 5, 3, -2, -7]
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= 'T' <= 100
1 <=  'N' <= 100
1 <= |'V'| <= 10^9

Where |V| denotes the absolute value of any stack element.

Time limit: 1 sec
```
