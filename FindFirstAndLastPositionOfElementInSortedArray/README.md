# Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

A maze is a rectangular grid of cells with walls between some of adjacent cells.
You would like to check whether there is a path from a given cell to a given
exit from a maze where an exit is also a cell that lies on the border of the maze.

**Task:** Given an undirected graph and two distinct vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣, check if there is a path between 𝑢 and 𝑣.

**Input Format:** An undirected graph with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges. The next line contains two vertices 𝑢
and 𝑣 of the graph.

**Output Format:** Output 1 if there is a path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 and 0 otherwise.

### Example 1
```sh
Input:  44
        12
        32
        43
        14
        14
Output: 1
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input:  42
        12
        32
        14
Output: 0
```

### Constraints
```sh
2 <= 𝑛 <= 10^3; 
1 <= 𝑚 <= 10^3; 
1 <= 𝑢, 𝑣 <= 𝑛; 
𝑢 != 𝑣.
```
