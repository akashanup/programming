### Example 1
```sh
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints
```sh
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
```
