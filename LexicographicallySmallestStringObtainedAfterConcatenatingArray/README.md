# Lexicographically smallest string obtained after concatenating array

Given n strings, concatenate them in an order that produces the lexicographically smallest possible string.

### Example 1
```sh
Input :  a[] = ["c", "cb", "cba"]
Output : cbacbc
Possible strings are ccbcba, ccbacb, cbccba, cbcbac, cbacbc and cbaccb. 
Among all these strings, cbacbc is the lexicographically smallest.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input :  a[] = ["aa", "ab", "aaa"]
Output : aaaaaab
```
