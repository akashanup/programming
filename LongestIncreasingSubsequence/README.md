# Longest Increasing Subsequence

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. 

### Example 1
```sh
Input: nums = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
Output: 6
Explanation: [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80]
```
