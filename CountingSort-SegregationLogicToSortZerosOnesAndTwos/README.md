# Counting Sort - Segregation logic to Sort an array of 0's, 1's and 2's 

Array consist of only 0's, 1's and 2's. Write an algorithm to sort  this array in O(n) time complexity and O(1) Space complexity with only one traversal.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: arr = [0 1 2 0 1 2]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2 2]
```
