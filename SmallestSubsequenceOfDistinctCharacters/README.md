# Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters

Given a string s, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s that contains all the distinct characters of s exactly once.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of lowercase English letters.
```
