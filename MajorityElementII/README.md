# Majority Element II

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
```
