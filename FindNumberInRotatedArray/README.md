# Find Number in Rotated Array

We rotate an ascending order sorted array at some point unknown to user. So for instance, 3 4 5 6 7 might become 5 6 7 3 4. Modify binary search algorithm to find an element in the rotated array in O(log n) time and O(1) Space complexity


### Example 1
```sh
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2], num = 1
Output: 8
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2], num = 5
Output: 2
```
