# Find the Rotation Count in Rotated Sorted array

Consider an array of distinct numbers sorted in increasing order. The array has been rotated (clockwise) k number of times. Given such an array, find the value of k.

### Example 1
```sh
Input : nums[] = {15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12}
Output: 2
Explanation : Initial array must be {2, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18}. We get the given array after rotating the initial array twice.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input : nums[] = {7, 9, 11, 12, 5}
Output: 4
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: nums[] = {7, 9, 11, 12, 15};
Output: 0
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
```
