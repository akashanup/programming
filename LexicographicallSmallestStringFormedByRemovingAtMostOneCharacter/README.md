# Lexicographically smallest string formed by removing at most one character

Given a string str, the task is to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing at most one character from the given string.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: str = "abcda"  
Output: abca
One can remove 'd' to get "abca" which is the lexicographically smallest string possible.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: str = "aaa' 
Output: aa
```
