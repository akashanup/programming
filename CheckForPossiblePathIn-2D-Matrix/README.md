# Check if a given sequence of moves for a robot is circular or not

Given a 2D array(m x n). The task is to check if there is any path from top left to bottom right. In the matrix, -1 is considered as blockage (canâ€™t go through this cell) and 0 is considered path cell (can go through it).

- Note: Top left cell always contains 0 

### Example 1
```sh
nput : arr[][] = {{ 0, 0, 0, -1, 0}, 
{-1, 0, 0, -1, -1}, 
{ 0, 0, 0, -1, 0}, 
{-1, 0, 0, 0, 0}, 
{ 0, 0, -1, 0, 0}} 
Output : Yes 
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input : arr[][] = {{ 0, 0, 0, -1, 0}, 
{-1, 0, 0, -1, -1}, 
{ 0, 0, 0, -1, 0}, 
{-1, 0, -1, 0, 0}, 
{ 0, 0, -1, 0, 0}} 
Output : No 
```
